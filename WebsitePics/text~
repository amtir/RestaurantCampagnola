The advertisement of the page on facebook has been accepted and has started. I will soon start the website. The advertisement of the page will last about a month and is a gift from us. Best regards, Ak.

Tell your friends can add their opinions about the restaurant (5* stars), I will add mine soon and also my evaluation on TripAdvisor. Also apart from advertising on facebook, you could organize marketing events to attract people. For instance, every Friday between 7pm to 8pm you could offer something without drinks and toppings. Another common idea would be to propose two menu for one.
