# Requirements definition for the grill restaurant campagnola WebSite

http://stonegrillrestaurantlacampagnola.com/

# The main goal and purpose of this website is to present the grill-restaurant to our users and customers and make them feel the atmosphere in the restaurant. We should also motivate them to visit us and convince/persuade them to reserve/book with us either for just a weekend-dinner or for a specific event. 

To be complete and consistent we will first show and demonstrate the particular atmosphere and decor in our restaurant, inspired from the American Road 66 restaurants in the united-states. Next we will present some meals, dishes, specialties, and desserts (steak & fish grilling, ribeye entrecote strip, tenderloin filet mignon T-bone vegetables banana flamb√©, sorbet). Finally, we will present the chef, his experience and his welcome to guests (Parma in Italy, then moved to USA). A small summary paragraph should be enough. We could also present the whole team.
 
Other functionalities offered by the website (nice to have):
Reservation for events (maximum 10 persons).
Another important feature would the possibility to reserve/book on-line. Customers should be able to reserve up-to 10 people. An e-mail confirmation/order should be sent to the manager of the restaurant. More than 10 persons, a phone call is required.
Customized menus for groups with specific budget.
Guest-book to leave a message or comments.


Here are various website examples and templates to choose from:

Domain website names: 
http://www.stonegrillrestaurantlacampagnola.com/ 
http://www.restaurantlacampagnola.com
http://www.restaurantcampagnola.com
http://www.campagnola.com

To offer a better and easier user experience, all the previous website domain names should point and converge to the same website content.

# Marketing and advertisement strategy

To increase the likelihood of income/revenue/earnings, we will
advertise the restaurant website on Facebook social media, targeting specific people, behaviors, regions, gender, and so on. (5 $ per day)
organize special events using social media support.
register and invite recommended and specialized institutions.
First of all, we need to get rid of all nonsense and irrelevant pictures with the business.
Similarly you are not using the top banner appropriately. At the back-ground you should use a picture of the restaurant and in front at the left side, a picture of you in the restaurant with the grill behind you. I have attached the pictures in the email. 

Either you do it by your self or just send me the details facebook-account (username password) and I will do it.

Best regards,
